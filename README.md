# Activity stats for Reddit
Have you ever wondered how often do you use Reddit? This simple Python program can generate you some stats about your active days.

## Features
  - Enter a username and after a few seconds the program will show you the average days between two days with activity (based on posts and comments), also median, minimum, maximum and the last day with activity (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - If you set the WRITE variable to True, the program will also write the number of days between activities in order to a file (diffs.txt), so you can make other stats from it (eg. with Excel)
  
## How to use?
First you have to enter your credentials into the code. You have to make an app <a href=https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps>on this page of Reddit</a>, so you will have access to the APIs. (Bottom of the page, for the type select script.) After you done that put this app's ID, secret code, your username and password to the right place in the code. (I didn't want to make my data public. :P) If you did everything right you can start the program now, enter a username and it will do its job.
